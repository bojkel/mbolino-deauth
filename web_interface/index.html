						It uses valid Wi-Fi frames described in the IEEE 802.11 standard and does not block or disrupt any frequencies.<br>
						Please check the legal regulations in your country before using it.<br>

						Please don't refer to this project as "jammer", that totally undermines the real purpose of this project!<br>
						If you do, it only proves that you didn't understand anything of what this project stands for.<br>
						Publishing content about this without without a proper explanation shows that you only do it for the clicks, 
						fame and/or money and have no respect for intellectual property, the community behind it and the fight for a better WiFi standard.<br>
